Last fall, the Swerik project, in collaboration with the CLARIN-ERIC, gathered researchers and other stakeholders at the Swedish Riksdag and had a productive workshop on researching the digitized Swedish parliamentary documents. Among the speakers were Jan Teorell (Stockholm University), Nina Tahmasebi (Gothenburg University), and Pelle Snickars (Lund University). The event was appreciated, especially the discussions of, for example, how to simultaneously build infrastructure and use it for research, as well as how to collaborate between researchers and non-university institutions. 

**On August 28–29, the Swerik project organizes a follow-up workshop on the same theme**. The purpose is foremost to provide both doctoral students and early-career scholars and senior researchers with a forum to discuss research ideas, results, and challenges related to Swedish parliamentary data. Moreover, the ambition is to create a network of researchers working on parliamentary sources.

The workshop is organized as a lunch-to-lunch event. The first day is dedicated to research presentations by senior scholars and institutions that facilitate parliamentary data that in various ways collaborate with the Swerik project. We end the first day with dinner at Movitz in Old Town. The second day is planned as another session of presentations by junior scholars. **If you wish to submit a proposal for a presentation on the second day, please send an abstract (ca 200 words, excl. a short bio).**
