Corpus of motions submitted to Parliament.

### What we've done

All  scanned motions fron 1867 through the Unicameral period have been OCR processed.

### Work underway

OCR-ed motions will be parsed into an XML schema similar to the <a href="/projects/parliamentary-recotds/" target="_blank">Parliamentary Records</a>.

### More to come...
